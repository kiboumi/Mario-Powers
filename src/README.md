<!-- ## Implementation Details

➡️Class-Based Population:

- We utilized classes to populate all data displayed on the website.
- The Football_Player class represents a generic football player and contains information such as name, position, appearances, and an infoPlayers method to display player statistics.
- Subclasses (Goalkeeper, Defender, Midfielder, and Forward) extend the Football_Player class and provide additional statistics specific to each player's position.
- Each subclass overrides the infoPlayers method to include position-specific statistics.
- The Football_Team class represents a Premier League team and contains information about the team's name, image, and players.
- The addPlayer method adds a player to the team's list of players.
- The renderTeamPlayers method renders the team's information, including its name, image, and a list of players with their respective statistics.
- The addToDropdown method adds the team's name to a dropdown menu for easy selection. -->
